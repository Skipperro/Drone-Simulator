My 8-years old son wants to design his own drone from scratch, including chassis design and code. This project is a tool that will help us test our design in virtual environment.

The idea is to make a platform where I could **accurately simulate all the real-world physics** like mass, gravity, wind, lift force ect. and put a drone into this environment. The drone is controlled using **separate code**, that is based only on sensors available in real-word like **accelerometer** or **IR distance sensor**. Drone's movement is also achieved by physics simulation **without any code-trickery**. Lift force is generated by spinning motors and is applied where the motor is located. Each motor have also delay when changing speed, just like real ones. Flight stability is not a result of forcing the drone to be in particular place by code, but by frequently adjusting each motor power in reaction to intput from onboard sensors and control commands.

This drone controlling code is flexible enough, to allow stable flight or hover even if:
* Center of thrust and mass are not aligned (ex. one side is heavier or motors are not placed symmetrically).
* Drone is carrying a delivery box that is heavier on one side or attached off-center.
* Wind with changing speed and direction is pushing drone away.
* There is no data from GPS or other space localization sensors (except accelerometer).

If done properly, the code responsible for controlling the drone should be **transferable to real-world hardware** and it would fly just like in the simulation. It would also work on any drone design, not only quadrocopters. 

This is still early-development phase, so real-world physic simulation could be improved, but it is already useable for basic flight testing.

Current game-features:
* Simple flight-test map.
* Controlling drone's flight (climb, pitch, roll, yaw).
* Hover mode - automatically try to keep still above specific point.
* Picking up and moving packages (3 different sizes/weights).
* Battery simulation + supercharging.
* Dynamic sounds with doppler effect.
* Music by Kevin MacLead (Incompetech).
